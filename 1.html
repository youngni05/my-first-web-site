<h2>HTML</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML" target = "_blank" title="html5 specification">
<strong>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</strong></a> is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.<br>
It defines the content and structure of web content.<br>
It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.</p>
<p>Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages.<br>
HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for its appearance.</p>
<p>HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages.
<br>With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page.<br> 
HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items. <br>
